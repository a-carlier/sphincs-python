# sphincs-python
This is a non-official SPHINCS+ python implementation based on SPHINCS+ algorithm of digital signatures which can be found at https://sphincs.org/.

DO NOT USE this program unless you know what you are doing. This work isn't official and hasn't been approved by anybody, it's main purpose was to understand how SPHINCS+ works and to try how we could use it. This program might have some flaws and is not meant to be fast.
